- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @shardmilne
- Iâ€™m a habitat restoration technician at Oxbow Farm and Conservation Center: https://www.oxbow.org/
- Most days I am on the farm with a shovel, managing invasive species. But sometimes I get left alone with a computer...
- I'm working on a small project addressing the causes of low plant diversity within ecological restoration sites, and identifying gaps in the plant diversity that we use to restore habitat!
- My scripts are probably not useful to anybody but me!
- I work in Python 3, and maybe sometimes in R.
- Contact me at shardmilne@gmail.com
